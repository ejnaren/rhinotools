###How to use:

    1 Select one or more blocks of a given definition.
    2 Run the "MakeUnique" script as described in the installation guide.
    3 All selected blocks of same definition will be replaced by a new block with a new definition.  
      The new block definition will have "#n" added to its name. Ie.: "WindowBlock#1","WindowBlock#2"..."WindowBlock#n".
